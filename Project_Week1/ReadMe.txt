THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

We've laid the groundwork for our project by incorporating Tailwind dependencies
for route configuration and styling. Using unique CSS styles,
We created the UI layouts for the Sign Up and Sign In pages. 
The next thing we need to do is use Google Firebase for user authentication so that
secure login and registration are possible.

We also intend to show movie details that we retrieve from the TMDB API on our homepage. 
By giving users access to a dynamic movie database, this will improve the
user experience and improve the functionality and engagement of our application.


This week I have accomplished in creating a basic layout and styling the SignIn Form.

Title:
Growth of the Internet/Web and Its Diverse Difficulties (Web 1.0 to Web 3.0)

Abstract:
With the World Wide Web (WWW) acting as the main worldwide information medium for data sharing,
reading, and writing, the Internet has grown to be an essential part of modern digital life.
This term paper outlines the shift from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0 and provides a thorough history of the web 
from its inception. Early versions of the Internet, known as Web 1.0, 
placed a strong emphasis on connectivity and information retrieval. 
Web 2.0 brought about a paradigm change by emphasising personal connections and encouraging 
user-generated content. Web 3.0, sometimes called the "web of knowledge," is the most recent iteration, 
distinguished by sophisticated semantic web technologies and perceptive data processing.

Web 1.0 is comparable to vintage black-and-white movies when it comes to moviemaking.
Web 2.0 is like the movie industry's move to colour and primitive 3D. Additionally, 
Web 3.0 would be like entering a brand-new universe with immersive experiences in the metaverse.

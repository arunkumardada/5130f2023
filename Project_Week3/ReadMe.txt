THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

Week 3 Progress Summary:
Our primary goal for the third week of the project was to integrate 
The Movie Database (TMDB) API into our application to improve its functionality.

Integration of TMDB API: In order to access a sizable database of movie information, 
we were able to successfully integrate the TMDB API into our application.
Obtaining current information about different movies,
such as their title, genre, release date, and other details.

Update Store with Movies Data: We made changes to our application's state management
system, which usually makes use of a store (like Redux),
in order to effectively handle the movie data that was retrieved. 

Creation of Movie Slice: We established a special "movie slice" in our 
state management system to further simplify the processing of data pertaining to movies. 

Planning for Main Container and Secondary Container:
In preparation for the display of movie information on the HOME page,
we started planning the structure of the main container and secondary containers. 
These containers are essential for organizing and presenting the movie data in a
user-friendly.

Fetching Data for Trailer Video: We started putting in place the ability to retrieve
trailer videos for every film, in addition to the standard movie information.
Watching trailers straight from the application is one way this feature enhances 
the user experience.


Tasks I have DONE:

Integration of getMovies API:
Successfully integrating the getMovies API is a crucial step in fetching movie data. 
This is foundational for keeping your movie data current and relevant for users.

THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

Week 4 Progress Summary:

Our primary goal for the fourth week of the project is to 
Incorporating the Popular, Top Rated, and Upcoming Movies into the application
was the main objective of this task. 
This required gathering information from the pertinent APIs, processing it, 
and then slickly adding it to the user interface.

Designed a clean and intuitive UI layout for the ChatGPT search bar.

The goal of this task was to implement a toggle function that smoothly 
switches the user interface between the home page and the search bar. 
Users can quickly navigate between the various sections of the application 
with this feature.

Tasks I have DONE:

Creating Movie cards for the NowPlaying, Popular Movies and Top Rated Movies.
And incorporated the API's for Popular, Top Rated and Upcoming Movies to display it in UI.

THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

Week 2 Progress Summary:

This week was primarily focused on setting up crucial aspects of the project. 
The main accomplishments revolved around the configuration of Google Firebase for user authentication and validation. 
Several key features were implemented:

Google Firebase Configuration:

Authentication setup using Firebase to validate user sign-up credentials.
Error handling for incorrect credentials, invalid email formats, and passwords using regex patterns.

Redux Integration:

Implementation of Redux for state management.
Dispatched actions for user login functionality.
Configured a single store to manage the application's state.
Accomplishments and Details:

Google Firebase Integration:

The team successfully configured Google Firebase to manage user authentication and validation. This involved the implementation of Firebase's authentication services to ensure the security and validation of user sign-up credentials. The system is now capable of detecting and handling errors related to incorrect login credentials, invalid email formats, and password criteria based on established regex patterns.

Redux Implementation:

The integration of Redux within the project architecture has provided a robust structure for managing the application's state. This implementation included the configuration of a single store to maintain a centralized state for the entire application. Additionally, actions for user login were dispatched using Redux, enhancing the overall user authentication process.

Upcoming Tasks - Week 3:

Moving forward, the focus will shift towards integrating the TMDb (The Movie Database) API. The objective is to fetch a comprehensive list of movies, including their titles, posters, and detailed descriptions. These fetched movie details will be utilized to design and display movie cards on the user interface.

Challenges Faced:

While the configuration of Firebase and Redux proceeded smoothly, some challenges were encountered
while ensuring seamless integration between these components and optimizing their functionalities.
Resolving these challenges demanded meticulous attention to detail and collaborative problem-solving within the team.

Tasks I have done: This week I have accomplished in creating a configuring googlefirebase for the user authentication/validation.
